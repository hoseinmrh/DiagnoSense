Okay, let's talk about what the AI analysis suggests based on the symptoms you've described.

The AI thinks the most likely possibility is **high blood pressure**, also known as hypertension.  It's important to remember that this prediction has a confidence level of about 10%, which isn't very high.  Think of it like this: out of ten similar cases, the AI might only get this one right.

* **Why does it think this?**  Mainly because you mentioned having headaches and dizziness.  The AI considers headaches to be a stronger indicator for high blood pressure in this case than dizziness.  It also noted you didn't report some symptoms that might be more common with other conditions, like chest pain or problems with balance.

* **What else could it be?**  The AI also considered a few other possibilities, like a migraine, a type of neck pain called cervical spondylosis, or even something more serious like paralysis due to a brain hemorrhage.  However, it considers these less likely than high blood pressure based on your reported symptoms.  These other possibilities had even lower confidence levels, around 4-6%.

* **Important Note:** This information comes from a computer program, not a doctor.  It's like using a search engine to get medical information – it can be helpful for understanding possibilities, but it's not a replacement for a professional opinion.  It's really important to talk to a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and discuss any concerns you have. They can perform a physical exam, ask more detailed questions, and run tests if needed to figure out what's really going on.
